# Augmentify

An AI driven platform designed to help researchers, learners and practitioners of machine learning, data science and Artificial Intelligence build less biased and more robust models. 
Data is key for building robust models and its usage cannot be over-emphasized. Unfortunately, there is hardly ever enought data for our use cases when building our models. The need for more data which are fit for training models is what gave birth to the idea of Augmentify which aims to provide practitioners which as much datasets as needed for their unique models using augmentation techniques.
